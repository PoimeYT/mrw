Sad news, Monkey Runners Rewritten will be shut down on the 9th of July EDT. 
The reason is Poime and @LynxVR have requested for us to take it down to make room for the Monkey Runners Remastered game they are making (SAME MAP WITH REVAMPS I THINK).
We will be online until the 10th of July. Thank you so much for playing Monkey Runners Rewritten, Goodbye fellow monke's.
